# **Coding Quiz Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**
For this assignment:
* I was attempting to create a interactive webpage that will quiz users on a few basic coding questions.
* Once users begin the quiz, they will be prompted with a question and choices for an answer. The timer will also begin to count down. If the user answers a question inccorrectly, they lose an addiotnal 10 seconds for every incorrect answer.
* After the game is over, the user will have ability to share their name, where their score and name will be saved to local storage.
